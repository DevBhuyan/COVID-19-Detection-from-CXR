# COVID-19-Detection-from-CXR
This is an attempt to Predict Covid-19 from Chest X-Ray images using Transfer Learning networks such as Inceptionv3, VGG-19, etc.
This project is based on the paper: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/exsy.12749
Work done was part of my 7th semester [project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sSIme8H2ztEttlDe9SwLYMnOK3CQvfoo/view?usp=sharing)

[This](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S33YkmiOx3uDBzWrBUhX7RNWIR75YIR_?usp=sharing) is the processed dataset used for this task.

The hyperparameters are tuned to the precise use-case. These were found to be optimal after extensive experimentation. Feel free to experiment. To test any network, simply download the corresponding ipynb file and change the input directory to your dataset directory and run it as a Jupyter notebook.

Feel free to use/modify the code. Consider giving a star or fork if it helps you.
